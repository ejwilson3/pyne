/*
 * This function discretizes the mesh attached to a geometry.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    mesh:             a vector of three vectors, each containing the
 * coordinates of the divisions in one direction of the actual mesh.
 *    vol_handles_ids:  a map of the EntityHandles and ids of the various
 * volumes of the geometry..
 *    num_rays: The number of rays to be fired.
 *    grid:     Whether the rays are to be fired evenly spaced apart or at
 * random. True if evenly spaced.
 *
 * Returns:
 *    A vector of the results for each row, consisting of the sum of the values
 * given by the fired rays as well as the sum of the values squared.
